# To-Do-List

This is a simple To-Do List application created with jQuery. The application allows the user to create, edit, and delete tasks to be completed, as well as mark tasks as complete. The application was created as a way to practice basic jQuery concepts, such as DOM manipulation and event handling.
You can find the live demo of this website at https://rochagbriel.github.io/to-do-list/.

## Technologies Used

The application uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling. HTML is used to structure the page, while CSS is used for styling. JavaScript is used to implement the application logic, and jQuery is used to simplify the code and make it easier to manipulate the DOM.

## Features

- Adding new tasks
- Editing existing tasks
- Deleting tasks
- Marking tasks as complete
- Storing tasks in the browser's local storage
- Rendering saved tasks in the task list upon page load
- Validating the task input field to prevent adding empty tasks.
